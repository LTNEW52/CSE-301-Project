                        How surely gravity’s law,<br>
                        strong as an ocean current,<br>
                        takes hold of even the strongest thing<br>
                        and pulls it toward the heart of the world.
                        <br><br>
                        Each thing-<br>
                        each stone, blossom, child –<br>
                        is held in place.<br>
                        Only we, in our arrogance,<br>
                        push out beyond what we belong to<br>
                        for some empty freedom.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        If we surrendered<br>
                        to earth’s intelligence<br>
                        we could rise up rooted, like trees.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        Instead we entangle ourselves<br>
                        in knots of our own making<br>
                        and struggle, lonely and confused.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        So, like children, we begin again<br>
                        to learn from the things,<br>
                        because they are in God’s heart;<br>
                        they have never left him.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        This is what the things teach us:<br>
                        to fall,<br>
                        patiently trusting our heaviness.<br>
                        Even a bird has to do that<br>
                        before he can fly.

                    <p>Nature Connection Exercise – Perceive and Receive</p>
                    <button class="more">Read more ➡</button>
                    <p class="hidden">
                        <br><br><br><br><br>
                        For this exercise find a place, any place, with some nature present (which, let’s face it, is anywhere and everywhere; the air you are breathing right now, even the body with which you perceive the world is part of ‘nature’).
                        <br><br>
                        In this practice, we begin by honing our powers of perception. Imagine you have just landed here on planet Earth and are experiencing this reality for the first time. What are you curious about? What do you notice? What aspects of the environment draw your attention?
                        <br><br>
                        Open and engage all the senses. What is it to see, hear, feel, smell? Direct your attention towards something that gives you pleasure in or around you. Allow your attention to be sustained on this object. Resist the habitual tendency to move on quickly to something else. Stay with it, explore and investigate all its qualities with the senses.
                        <br><br>
                        What happens when you stay with the experience? Often the more we look, the more we see, as new layers of detail begin to emerge as the subtleties and nuances of an image give themselves up to the patient eye. Rich detail that we never imagined existed in something so ‘everyday’, begins to emerge.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you have ‘perceived’ it, then open fully to ‘receiving’ it – open to the experience as if you were taking it in to your mind and body, savouring and enjoying the details, the nuances, and the flavours of experience.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="Image/Earth.jpg" alt="Forrest">
                        <br>
                        It starts with intention – deliberately guiding your attention towards a particular object; then perception – attending to what you are perceiving. Then we can experiment with simply opening and surrendering to the experience; to really allow the experience to nourish you, you can imagine the experience flowing into you, as you simply open and receive the goodness that you perceive.
                        <br><br>
                        Tune into the experience in body and mind: How does it feel? What sensations, emotions, and thoughts are arising? Savour any pleasant feelings, basking in their warm glow.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this process we are training the attention to be flexible: We shift between an external focus and an inner focus, noticing how there is really no separation between inner and outer but simply different aspects of our present moment reality that we can attend to and enjoy.
                        <br><br>
                        This process need only take 30 seconds or a couple of minutes (always nice to indulge for longer if you can) but it can have a subtle yet powerful effect on your ability to reduce stress and increase your emotional well-being.</p>

                    <p>OpenAI expands its custom model training program</p>
                    <button class="more">Read more ➡</button>
                    <p class="hidden">
                        <br><br><br><br><br>
                        OpenAI is expanding a program, Custom Model, to help enterprise customers develop tailored generative AI models using its technology for specific use cases, domains and applications.
                        <br><br>
                        Custom Model launched last year at OpenAI’s inaugural developer conference, DevDay, offering companies an opportunity to work with a group of dedicated OpenAI researchers to train and optimize models for specific domains. “Dozens” of customers have enrolled in Custom Model since. But OpenAI says that, in working with this initial crop of users, it’s come to realize the need to grow the program to further “maximize performance.”
                        <br><br>
                        Hence assisted fine-tuning and custom-trained models.
                        <br><br>
                        Assisted fine-tuning, a new component of the Custom Model program, leverages techniques beyond fine-tuning — such as “additional hyperparameters and various parameter efficient fine-tuning methods at a larger scale,” in OpenAI’s words — to enable organizations to set up data training pipelines, evaluation systems and other supporting infrastructure toward bolstering model performance on particular tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        As for custom-trained models, they’re custom models built with OpenAI — using OpenAI’s base models and tools (e.g. GPT-4) — for customers that “need to more deeply fine-tune their models” or “imbue new, domain-specific knowledge,” OpenAI says.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="Image/Openai.jpg" alt="OpenAi">
                        <br>
                        OpenAI gives the example of SK Telecom, the Korean telecommunications giant, who worked with OpenAI to fine-tune GPT-4 to improve its performance in “telecom-related conversations” in Korean. Another customer, Harvey — which is building AI-powered legal tools with support from the OpenAI Startup Fund, OpenAI’s AI-focused venture arm — teamed up with OpenAI to create a custom model for case law that incorporated hundreds of millions of words of legal text and feedback from licensed expert attorneys.
                        <br><br>
                        “We believe that in the future, the vast majority of organizations will develop customized models that are personalized to their industry, business, or use case,” OpenAI writes in a blog post. “With a variety of techniques available to build a custom model, organizations of all sizes can develop personalized models to realize more meaningful, specific impact from their AI implementations.”
                        <br><br>
                        OpenAI is flying high, reportedly nearing an astounding $2 billion in annualized revenue. But there’s surely internal pressure to maintain pace, particularly as the company plots a $100 billion data center co-developed with Microsoft (if reports are to be believed). The cost of training and serving flagship generative AI models isn’t coming down anytime soon after all, and consulting work like custom model training might just be the thing to keep revenue growing while OpenAI plots its next moves.
                        <br><br>
                        Fine-tuned and custom models could also lessen the strain on OpenAI’s model serving infrastructure. Tailored models are in many cases smaller and more performant than their general-purpose counterparts, and — as the demand for generative AI reaches a fever pitch — no doubt present an attractive solution for a historically compute-capacity-challenged OpenAI.
                        <br><br>
                        Alongside the expanded Custom Model program and custom model building, OpenAI today unveiled new model fine-tuning features for developers working with GPT-3.5, including a new dashboard for comparing model quality and performance, support for integrations with third-party platforms (starting with the AI developer platform Weights & Biases) and enhancements to tooling. Mum’s the word on fine-tuning for GPT-4, however, which launched in early access during DevDay.

                    <p>Solo Leveling Season 1 Review</p>
                    <button class="more">Read more ➡</button>
                    <p class="hidden">
                        <br><br><br><br><br>
                        Is Solo Leveling, the manwha-turned-anime phenomenon that just ended its first season, pure power fantasy? Absolutely, but it’s a power fantasy that works because of how it breaks down the barriers between real life and gaming. Wouldn't it be cool if your post-workout exhaustion were relieved instantly, and you could see tangible results right there and then? Wouldn't it be amazing if you could see yourself become smarter, stronger, and more perceptive just because of a few completed chores? Sung Jinwoo’s unique circumstances in an MMORPG-inspired world of missions and monsters may be ludicrous, but they’re fun to watch, too. Solo Leveling is clearly a show made by gamers, for gamers, translating the mechanics, the tropes, and even the tedious parts of gaming into captivating animated form.
                        <br><br>
                        It’s a fresh coat of paint on an old anime standby: The training arc. Once the most hapless and unskilled member of the dungeon-trolling masses Solo Leveling refers to as “hunters,” Jinwoo finds himself the only one of these magically equipped adventurers capable of growing in strength, "leveling up" as if his life were a game. This is what makes or breaks Solo Leveling, and it's the best part of the anime. The fights in Season 1 reflect this, feeling very much like the power progression in a Soulslike. When an enemy is too strong, Jinwoo simply leaves to farm experience with lower-level monsters, then he returns and the fight is manageable. It’s silly, clever, and thrilling.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="Image/soloLeveling.jpg" alt="sololeveling anime">
                        <br>
                        A-1 Pictures delivers a stunning action show with plenty of eye candy in the form of dazzling visual effects and dynamic fight choreography, and a stunning soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano. After a while, however, the combat starts to feel empty, too easy, and devoid of stakes or tension. Even in the finale, when a quest pits Jinwoo against wave after wave of armored soldiers, the overwhelming number of enemies doesn't amount to much of a threat (at least not for long). But this is a feature of Solo Leveling, not a bug: Eventually, every fight becomes too easy for Jinwoo, which makes the arrival of a new challenge all the more exciting because the rest of the season has taught us the difference in difficulty between, say, slaying a pack of wolf monsters and defeating a towering knight in crimson armor. The cycle of quests, raids, and repetitive monsters may grow weary, and it doesn't help Jinwoo's development as he’s essentially just going through the motions without much agency or nuance in the writing. Still, as the final moments of the season show (and as readers know), this is merely the prologue to a larger, more meaningful arc for Jinwoo.
                        <br><br>
                        The first episode of Solo Leveling was an effective introduction to its world, which the rest of the season expands in interesting ways. The ramifications of an economy driven by monsters, raids, and mana crystals are explored in subplots about rival guilds fight over the rights to raid portals, where they can not only mine crystals (which results in profits) but also to train new hunters. Yet despite all this, Season 1 is smart enough to remind us time and again that what’s become big business to some is the prevention of armageddon to others.

                    <p>Joker: Folie à Deux First Poster Shows a Dancing Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga</p>
                    <button class="more">Read more ➡</button>
                    <p class="hidden">
                        <br><br><br><br><br>
                        Warner Bros. has not only shared the first poster for Joker: Folie à Deux, but it also revealed we'll be getting the sequel's much-anticipated debut trailer on April 9.
                        <br><br>
                        The poster, which was shared by Joker's official X/Twitter account, is a striking one that features Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn dancing under a light shining through a window. Could it be from inside the walls of Arkham State Hospital or a prison? Either way, they appear to be inside a brick building of sorts.
                        <br><br>
                        Joker himself is in a tuxedo and is holding a cigarette, while Harley is in a white dress and has red makeup all over her face, which could be from a kiss from the Joker.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="Image/joker.jpg" alt="Joker">
                        <br>
                        Finally, the poster features the words "The World is a Stage," while reminding us the film will arrive in theaters on October 4, 2024.
                        <br><br>
                        The poster's image is very similar to one director Todd Phillips shared on Valentine's Day, but that featured the pair on top of a building instead of in one. In that image, which you can see below, they look to be on a stage production of a Gotham rooftop.
                        <br><br>
                        The upcoming trailer should finally reveal more concrete details of what we can expect from this movie, but we already do know it will exist outside of James Gunn and Peter Safran's DCU and will actually call DC Elseworlds its home. It's also rumored to be a musical, and these images and poster lean into that for sure.
                        <br><br>
                        In our 10/10 review of 2019's Joker, we said it "isn’t just an awesome comic book movie, it’s an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix’s fully committed performance and Todd Phillips’ masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
                        <br><br>
                        For more, check out how Warner Bros. is reportedly spending more than double the original's budget on this sequel and more of the biggest upcoming movies of 2024.

                    <p>Jupiter’s most interesting moons</p>
                    <button class="more">Read more ➡</button>
                    <p class="hidden">
                        <br><br><br><br><br>
                        Jupiter isn’t just king of the planets because its big, the gas giant also has the most moons. In total, scientists think Jupiter has 79 moons. Only 53 of those are named while the others await official designation.
                        <br><br>
                        Though all of Jupiter’s moons are of interest, four in particular stand out, the Galilean satellites. These are Jupiter’s largest moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto and, as their name suggests, they were first spotted by astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610. But what makes these four moons so special?
                        <br><br>
                        GANYMEDE
                        <br>
                        <img src="Image/Ganymede.png" alt="Ganymede">
                        <br>
                        Ganymede is the solar system’s largest moon and the only natural satellite with its own magnetic field. Because of its magnetic field, Ganymede has its own northern lights around the regions near its north and south poles.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1996, Hubble found evidence that Ganymede has a thin oxygen atmosphere, but researchers think it’s far too thin to support life as we know it.
                        <br><br>
                        Ganymede’s surface is a predominately icy and a crisscrossed collection of old and new(er) terrain. The dark regions are heavily cratered, indicating that it may be the original crust of the satellite. The lighter regions are much younger and smooth, possibly the result of tensional faulting or the release of water from beneath Ganymede’s surface.
                        <br><br>
                        IO
                        <br>
                        <img src="Image/Io.jpg" alt="Io">
                        <br>
                        Io (pronounced “EYE oh”) is the most volcanically active world in the solar system. Hundreds of volcanoes dot its surface. Lava fountains, dozens of miles high, erupt from some of them. Io has a combination of Jupiter, Europa and Ganymede and their gravitational tug of war to thank for its high activity.
                        <br><br>
                        A bit larger than the Moon, Io is Jupiter’s third largest moon. It is tidally locked to Jupiter, meaning that only one side ever faces that planet during its orbit. The Moon is similarly tidally locked to Earth. But unlike the Moon which has a mostly circular orbit, Io’s is elliptical. This causes the moon to experience tremendous tidal forces. As Io goes about its orbit, the gravitational effects on one side are great than that on the other, this causes the Io’s surface to bulge up and down. The same effect can be seen on Earth because of the Moon. But where the Moon pulls Earth’s tides to highs and lows of about 60 feet (18 meters), Io’s surface is fluctuating by as much as 330 feet (100 meters).

                        But Io causes just as much trouble for Jupiter. At an orbit of about 262,000 miles (422,000 kilometers), Io crosses Jupiter’s magnetic field, turning the moon into a giant electric generator. The current generated by Io then cuts back to Jupiter and creates lightening in the gas giant’s upper atmosphere.

                        All in all, Io is chaotic and although life has been found even in the most inhospitable locations on Earth, most researchers don’t think this moon is unlikely to host any.

                        The Voyager spacecrafts flew by Europa in 1979 and scientists got their first hints that the moon’s icy surface might be hiding an ocean of liquid water. Ever since, humanity has imagined countless science fiction scenarios for alien life to be thriving in a Europan ocean.
                        <br><br>
                        And sci-fi writers aren’t the only ones intrigued by life on this moon. Europa’s shell is approximately 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 kilometers) thick and beneath it lies an ocean 40 to 100 miles (60 to 150 kilometers) deep. If true, that would mean Europa holds twice as much water as all of Earth’s oceans combined on a body only a quarter of our planet’s diameter.
                        <br><br>
                        Recently the Hubble Space Telescope also spotted signs that some of that water may be leaking out into space, meaning it would be possible for a spacecraft to sample Europa’s ocean without ever touching down.

                        Of the main requirements astrobiologists think are necessary for life, Europa is seemingly only lacking an energy source. Jupiter is about 5.2 astronomical units — where 1 AU is the average distance between the Sun and Earth — from the Sun, so any sunlight that reaches Europa is about 25 times fainter than at Earth. So, while sunlight isn’t a good energy source, NASA’s Galileo spacecraft saw signs of convection occurring in Europa’s ice layer. Galileo explored the Jupiter system from 1995 to 2003. During that time, it spotted pits and domes on Europa’s surface. Heating from below could be the culprit, causing the cooler, dense ice to sink while the warmer less-dense ice rises.
